# DSS Web Dev & Web Scraping Onboarding
Hi DSS Newbies! Here are the exercises (and some template code) for y'all to use in learning web dev and web scraping.

To start off with, we'll be using VS Code. Please install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey (Extension ID: ritwickdey.LiveServer) to see changes rendered in HTML/CSS/JS! 

# HTML / CSS
We've created a template HTML file in this repo, but the way we created it was Ctrl + Space -> HTML Sample. 

# JS 
Try out a couple of these simple exercises. JS can help modularize the process as well as add more interactability to the website (the latter will not be covered).

# Web Scraping 
The exercises are listed in the bs4_exercises file. Follow along at your own pace! If you would like one more challenging exercise, check out [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/search?content=recipe). Try to grab all the recipe ingredient lists from this website (pay attention to how the url changes as you scroll for more recipes).

Additionally, there's a demo for selenium, which allows you to interact with a web page, but in the interest of time, this is something you can look into on your free time. Check out the [BS4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#translating-this-documentation) and [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html) documentation!
