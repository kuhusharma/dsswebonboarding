# DSS Web Dev & Web Scraping Onboarding
Hi DSS Newbies! Here are the exercises (and some template code) for y'all to use in learning web dev and web scraping.

To start off with, we'll be using VS Code. Please install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey (Extension ID: ritwickdey.LiveServer) to see changes rendered in HTML/CSS/JS! 

# HTML / CSS
We've created a template HTML file in this repo, but the way we created it was Ctrl + Space -> HTML Sample. 

# JS 

# Web Scraping 


# Github Pages / Netlify
